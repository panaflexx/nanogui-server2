Packaging
=========

Distributing via PyPI
---------------------

The easiest way to get started is by cloning the `nanobind_example repository
<https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind_example>`_, which is a minimal C++ project
with nanobind-based bindings compiled via CMake and `scikit-build
<https://scikit-build.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_. It also shows how to use
GitHub Actions to automatically generate and deploy binary wheels for a variety
of platforms.
